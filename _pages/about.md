Oh hey there -- It's nice to see you visiting this page! 

My name is Jack (aka KKB), I'm a current Security Consultant and Security Researcher at [NCC Group](https://twitter.com/NCCsecurityUS). My main focus lies in the areas of Web Application and Network Penetration Testing, but I also have experience in Red Teaming, Physical Security, AWS Security, ICS/SCADA, Secure Code Review, Hardware/Electronics and some Secure Code Review.

This page will contain posts on my learning experiences, challenges, projects, or just research in my spare time. I hope you enjoy the posts and hopefully learn something new. If you would like to see posts on a certain topic, just reach out to me and I'll see what I can do. Also, feedback is much appreciated!

Cheers!

Jack
