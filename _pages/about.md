Oh hey there -- It's nice to see you visiting this page! Since you're here, let me introduce myself. My name is Jack, I'm a current Information Security Analyst working toward becoming a Pen Tester/Consultant. This page will contain posts on my learning experiences, challenges, projects, or just research in my spare time.

Hope you enjoy the posts -- feedback is much appreciated!

Cheers!

Jack
