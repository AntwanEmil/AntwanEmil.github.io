Another one... over a million records were released to the public; usernames, passwords, credit card information. It's just another breach in a long line of breaches. The year of 2015, and 2016 was pretty big for breaches, affecting major companies and many users worldwide. It's become of norm now, with the ever expanding field of technology... cyber security is gruelingly trying to keep up with the ever evolving threat of cyber crime.

In February, 2016 - Mandiant (now acquired by FireEye) released its prominent 2016 M-Trend Report. This report, provided trends, along with statistics and case studies to show how advanced threats (malicious actors) have evolved over the years; relevantly from 2014-2015. After thoroughly reading this report, and compiling a wide range of data from other source such as [Kaspersky Labs]( http://usa.kaspersky.com/), and [Praesidio]( https://www.defensestorm.com/); I decided to provide a brief overview of the current Cyber Threat Trends Report, itâ€™s data, and list possible mitigation techniques useful for defending companies, and home users alike.


## Overview:
The M-Trends Report begins by explaning to us that there has been an increased activity coming straight from Russia (through single and state sponsed threats), all of them mostly being financially motivated. At the same time Chinese based threats have seemed to balance out with Non-Chinese threats, and malcious actors. Cocurrntly with the increased activity, we have also seen a skyrocket of attacks.

Mandiant reported that with the increase of the activity, there have also been an increase in the amount of company breaches. One would think that a breach in a company would be spotted rather quickly, but the data is quite shocking. It is reported, that the "median" number of days a company is compromised - before the breach was discovered by Mandiant - is a whopping 146 days! This might seem a lot at first, but in all honesty it has improved over the years.

Even though, the numbers still seem big, we can say that a 59 day improvement since 2014 is a good thing! With the increase of the cyber security sector, and security awareness, we are slowly getting to a point where breaches are becoming more and more detectable. Mandiant also reported that besides the 146 days it takes them to discover that a company has been compromised, it takes approximately 56 days for a company to internally discover a breach, and a shocking 320 days before a 3rd party notifies the company. It is also stated that over 53% of the breaches are reported though external entities, while 47% of the breaches are reported internally.

With the increase of breaches, there was also an increase in the way attacks were carried out on companies. Ranging from a huge increase in "disruptive attacks", to exporting of PII, and the exploitation of network devices. These three categories of attacks contained the following threat vectors, followed by their subcategories:

* Disruptive Attacks
  * Ransomware
  * Extortion
  * Deleting & Damaging of Data/Systems
  * Modification of Repositories and Critical Business Data
* PII Leaks
  * Phishing Emails
* Attack on Network Devices
