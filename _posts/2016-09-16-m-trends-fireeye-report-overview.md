Another one... over a million records were released to the public; usernames, passwords, credit card information. It's just another breach in a long line of breaches. The year of 2015, and 2016 was pretty big for breaches, affecting major companies and many users worldwide. It's become of norm now, with the ever expanding field of technology... cyber security is grueling trying to keep up.

In February, 2016 - Mandiant (now acquired by FireEye) released its prominent 2016 M-Trend Report. This report, provided trends, along with statistics and case studies to show how advanced threats (malicious actors) have evolved over the years; relevantly from 2014-2015. After thoroughly reading this report, and compiling a wide range of data from other source such as [Kaspersky Labs]( http://usa.kaspersky.com/), and [Praesidio]( https://www.defensestorm.com/); I decided to provide a brief overview of the current Cyber Threat Trends Report, itâ€™s data, and list possible mitigation techniques useful for defending companies, and home users alike.
