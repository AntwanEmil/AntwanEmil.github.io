\- *Mr. Robot, 2016*


Hello, and welcome to my first installment of the VulnHub VM Write-ups!

If you never heard of [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/about/), then let me briefly explain what they do. Their purpose it to provide materials that allows anyone to gain practical 'hands-on' experience in digital security, computer software & network administration. Like many other CTF's, VulnHub in particular was born to cover as many resources as possible, creating a catalogue of 'stuff' that is (legally) 'breakable, hackable & exploitable' - allowing you to learn in a safe environment and practice 'stuff' out. [__Quoted from VulnHub__]

Before we begin, if you would like to try out the __Mr.Robot VM__, or follow along and learn as I go, then you can download it [here](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/)!

Almighty then, I know you're as eager as me to get your hands dirty with this CTF - so, let's begin!

## Description:
